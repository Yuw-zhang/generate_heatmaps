## Mapping Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Colorectal Cancer with Pathomics (Preprint:https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6173056/v1)
We created the tool to visualize the deep learning-based patch-level tumor and lymphocyte classifications from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs).
## Running the code
svs_fol: The folder for whole slide images
cancer_fol: directory of tumor prediction txt files
til_fol: directory of TILs prediction txt files
output_pred: output path

python main.py
